                <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
                <p>
                    My work experience gently has introduced me to the world of work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s all about networking....<br>
                    It definitely gave me a good understanding of my strengths and weakness,where i got to learn the do’s and don’ts, and learned to navigate my way through the jungle of work politics.<br>
                    <br>
                    It gave me an idea of the skills i might need to thrive in the workplace.

                    Education
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Education is about teaching, learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizens.

                    They say with different language different personality.<br>
                    Foreign Language study creates more positive attitudes and less prejudice toward people who are different.<br><br>
                    Analytical skills improve when someone study a foreign language.<br>
                    Business skills plus foreign language skills make an employee more valuable in the marketplace.<br>
                    Dealing with another culture enables people to gain a more profound understanding of their own culture.

                <h3>Interests and Hobbies
                </h3>
                <p>
                    According to licensed professional counselor Rebecca Weiler, when you’re engaged and fulfilled in your life outside of work (like you are when you’re pursuing meaningful hobbies), that happiness spills over. It can make you more focused and enthusiastic when you’re on the job.<br><br>
                    Having a hobby that you enjoy whatever it is, has all sorts of well-documented benefits, from lower levels of stress to an increased sense of belonging and purpose.<br><br>
                    "Do it yourself" ("DIY") is the method of building, modifying, or repairing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals. <br><br>
                    Jigsaw puzzle is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of often oddly shaped interlocking and tessellating pieces. Each piece usually has a small part of a picture on it; when complete, a jigsaw puzzle produces a complete picture.
